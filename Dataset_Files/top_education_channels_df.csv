Welcome to TKOR, around here we are all about making Science A lifestyle! Not only is science in EVERYTHING we do, but it is what literally keeps the world spinning and your feet on the ground! We take textbook knowledge and bring it to life while learning right along side you! Come hang out with us, do a science and let your knowledge run wild! 

TKOR was founded by Grant Thompson in 2012! He had a knack for sharing and discovering the unknown which is why he is forever The King of Random! Unfortunately Grant passed away on July 19th, 2019 in a paragliding accident. 

His legacy has since been carried out by Team TKOR! Nate and Cali were previous team members and our current team leader is Grace Dirig! She has an infectious energy in all she does especially sharing science! If there’s something to be learned and explored, she’s going to be exploring right alongside you! 

Subscribe and come join the team every Friday as we unleash our inner scientist!
