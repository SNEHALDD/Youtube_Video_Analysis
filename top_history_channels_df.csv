UClfEht64_NrzHf8Y0slKEjw,AlternateHistoryHub,"An entire channel dedicated to the 'What If?"".  Using knowledge of geography, population and other historical facts I predict what could have happened had things gone differently in history.

Learn about how the world would be different if, the Axis won World War II, if America lost the Revolution, or if Reagan was never president. I do pop culture videos which explored the worlds of Fallout and the Purge.  Learn controversial topics such as if Christianity never existed and many other subjects.
